# Recruitment Chess

## Rules

The rules are the same as regular chess, except for these changes:

1. The starting position has only Kings (on e1 and e8) and pawns (on the second and seventh ranks). The remaining pieces (A queen, two rooks, two knights and two bishops) are in each player's *inventory*.
2. On their turn, a player can either move a piece already on the board or insert one piece from their inventory.
3. When inserting a piece, it can go in any empty square, not controlled by the opponent and without giving a check. In other words, an inserted piece cannot give a check immediately and must survive at least one move.
4. Black wins in case of a draw.
5. If a rook is inserted in one of the corners of the board, castling becomes possible, with the standard chess rules.

## Corollaries

1. You cannot insert to parry a check, as the inserted piece would be under attack.
2. You can insert in a square controlled by a pinned piece, as that piece is not really controlling the square
3. Captured pieces don't go back into any player's inventory and thus cannot be re-inserted.
4. Once each player has inserted all of their pieces, the game proceeds as a standard Armageddon chess game.
